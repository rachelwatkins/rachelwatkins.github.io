            <h2>We run Rivers to relax.</h2>
            <p>We believe that there is nothing like a river trip for <em>relaxing</em>. That is why we subscribe to the dry oar philosophy of boating. Keeping your oars dry for us means taking time to look around and notice the <strong>beauty</strong> that surrounds the rivers we love.</p>

            <h2>We run Whitewater for the Rush.</h2>
            <p>That doesn't mean we don't also like rapids. Opposites in all things after all. We believe that that tenseness that comes when you are looking down the tongue of a big string of waves makes you appreciate the calm beautiful water that always follows even more.</p>
